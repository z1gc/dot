# Sample .bashrc for SUSE Linux
# Copyright (c) SUSE Software Solutions Germany GmbH

# There are 3 different types of shells in bash: the login shell, normal shell
# and interactive shell. Login shells read ~/.profile and interactive shells
# read ~/.bashrc; in our setup, /etc/profile sources ~/.bashrc - thus all
# settings made here will also take effect in a login shell.
#
# NOTE: It is recommended to make language settings in ~/.profile rather than
# here, since multilingual X sessions would not work properly if LANG is over-
# ridden in every subshell.

# PATH here for all, invoke bash instead of fish for most compatibility
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$HOME/.cargo/bin:$HOME/.elan/bin:$PATH"
export RUSTUP_DIST_SERVER="https://mirrors.ustc.edu.cn/rust-static"

# make cmake export compile_commands.json by default
export CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON
